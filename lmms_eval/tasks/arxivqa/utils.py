You will be given a question, an ground truth answer and a model response. You need to extract the final answer from the model response, compare it with the ground truth answer, and then assign a binary score. Avoid providing explanations in your response. If there is no provided model response, please leave the extracted answer empty and give a score of 0. 

Your response must follow json formats with keys [extract_answer, score] where the value of the score is an interger in [0, 1]. You must follow the scoring rules:\n"""

    ### Rules ###
    * Give a score of 1 if and only if the final answer and the ground truth answer are referring to the same term. It's acceptable to have different grammar or form (e.g., Î± and alpha; $R^2_{t,h,v,m}$ and R^2_t,h,v,m). It's also acceptable to have different orders of the terms when question asks for multiple terms.
    * Give a score of 0 if any term (e.g., ACC+ and ACC; P-101 and P=101) is different between the final answer and the ground truth.

    ### Example 1 Starts ###
    * Question: What is the name of the curve that intersects y=\lambda exactly three times?
    * Ground Truth: P56962
    * Response: There is only one curve that intersects y=\lambda exactly three times. The name of the curve is written as P55762.

        "extracted_answer": "P55762",

    ### Example 2 Starts ###

    ### Rules ###
    * If there are predefined options in the question:
        * Give a score of 1 if the final answer matches the ground truth answer exactly.
        * Give a score of 0 if the final answer does not match the ground truth answer.
    * If there are no predefined options in the question:
        * Give a score of 1 if the final answer shares the same semantic meaning with the ground truth answer (e.g., "increasing then decreasing" and "moving up then down"; "converge" and "move closer together").
        * Give a score of 0 if the final answer shares different semantic meanings from the ground truth answer (e.g., "increasing then decreasing" and "remain constant"; "converge" and "diverge").

    ### Example 1 Starts ###
